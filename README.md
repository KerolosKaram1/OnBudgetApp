 **Project Scope:**

   - The "On Budget" project is designed to streamline the shopping experience for clothing items from both local and online brands. The project includes iOS and Android mobile 
   applications along with a web platform. Leveraging AI-driven features, users can discover, 
   purchase, and manage clothing items while staying within their budget.
 
  - The project aims to create a seamless interaction between sellers and clients, bridging the gap between physical stores and online shopping.

**Features:**

   - Integrating both online and offline stores can provide customers with a seamless shopping experience whether they're shopping from home or physically visiting a store.
   - This feature can bridge the gap between online and offline shopping, offering customers the convenience of browsing items online and then trying them on or purchasing them in- 
     store.

 *2. Budget-Based Recommendations:*
   - Allowing users to set a budget and receive tailored recommendations within that budget is a great way to enhance the shopping experience.
   - This feature helps users make more informed decisions and ensures they find items that match their financial preferences.

 *3. Shipping Policy and Options:*
   - Recommending various shipping companies along with their prices gives users the flexibility to choose the shipping option that best fits their needs and budget.
   - Transparent shipping policies enhance trust and allow users to have more control over their shopping experience.

 *4. Image Tagging/Recognition:*
   - This feature, if implemented using image recognition technology, can enhance the user experience by enabling users to take pictures of clothing items they like and find 
     similar products in your app.
   - Visual search can make it easier for users to find products that match their preferences, even if they can't describe them in words.

 *5. Product Recommendations:*
   - By analyzing user behavior and preferences, the app can provide personalized product recommendations. This feature can help increase sales and customer satisfaction by showing users items that align with their tastes.

 *6. "Customers Also Bought" and "Frequently Bought Together":*
   - These features can encourage users to explore complementary products, potentially leading to higher average order values and increased sales.

 *7. Seasonal and Trending Recommendations:*
   - Providing seasonal and trending recommendations keeps the app relevant and up-to-date with fashion trends. It shows that your app is actively curating the latest styles for users.

 *8. Chatbot:*
   - A chatbot can provide real-time customer support, answer user queries, help with recommendations, and assist with common issues.
   - Chatbots enhance user engagement and customer satisfaction by providing immediate assistance.

By integrating these unique features with the foundational components of a typical online shopping app , our project can showcase how technology and innovation are shaping the future of retail and improving the shopping experience for users.
