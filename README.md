   - The "On Budget" project is designed to streamline the shopping experience for clothing items from both local and online brands. The project includes iOS and Android mobile 
   applications along with a web platform. Leveraging AI-driven features, users can discover,

     store.

 *2. Budget-Based Recommendations:*

   - These features can encourage users to explore complementary products, potentially leading to higher average order values and increased sales.

 *7. Seasonal and Trending Recommendations:*
   - Providing seasonal and trending recommendations keeps the app relevant and up-to-date with fashion trends. It shows that your app is actively curating the latest styles for users.

 *9. Chatbot:*
